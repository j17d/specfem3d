   ...checking mesh resolution

 ********
 minimum and maximum number of elements
 and points in the CUBIT + SCOTCH mesh:

 NSPEC_global_min =        80704
 NSPEC_global_max =        80704
 NSPEC_global_max / NSPEC_global_min imbalance =    1.00000000      =    0.00000000      %
 NSPEC_global_sum =      1291264

 NGLOB_global_min =      5323729
 NGLOB_global_max =      5323729
 NGLOB_global_max / NGLOB_global_min imbalance =    1.00000000      =    0.00000000      %
 NGLOB_global_sum =     85179664

 If you have elements of a single type (all acoustic, all elastic, all poroelastic, and without CPML)
 in the whole mesh, then there should be no significant imbalance in the above numbers.
 Otherwise, it is normal to have imbalance in elements and points because the domain decomposer
 compensates for the different cost of different elements by partitioning them unevenly among processes.
