This example creates a small mesh with regular elements and surrounded by a C-PML absorbing boundary.
The PML boundary layers are added as extensions to the (original) mesh by default, using the 'ADD_PML_AS_EXTRA_MESH_LAYERS' parameter.

For comparison the DATA/meshfem3D_files/Mesh_Par_file.inscribed could be used to define the same PML boundary, but using elements 
defined within the (original) mesh dimension specification.

To run this simulation, type:
> ./run_this_example.sh
