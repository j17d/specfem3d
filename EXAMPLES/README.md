README
======

This folder contains various SPECFEM3D simulation examples.
The sections include:
- :point_right: **applications/**: user examples to familiarize yourself with different modeling setups

- **benchmarks/**: examples for testing purposes and validation of the code

- **real_world/**: examples dealing with local and regional simulation setups from real world locations

- **reproducible_study/**: simulation setups to reproduce published results


If you're interested in how to setup and run a simple SPECFEM3D simulation, we suggest to look at **applications/** examples.
Please **consider submitting your own example** to this package!
